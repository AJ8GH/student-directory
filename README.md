The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.

## Objectives of exercise ##
* Build a working command line app to track and manage a directory of Students.

## App functionality ##
* Add students to the directory
* Save added students to a chosen file
* Display all enrolled students
* Display students grouped by their cohort
* Load students from a file
* Delete students individually
* Delete an entire cohort
* Print the app source code to the console

## How to use ##

Clone this repository:
* git@github.com:AJ8GH/student-directory.git

If spot any issues, or if you have ideas on how the app could be improved, either functionally, or design-wise, I'd love to hear them!
