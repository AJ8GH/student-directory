The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy.

## Objectives of exercise
The goal of this project was to build an interactive command line application which can be used to store and manage a directory of Students (villains). By Making use of Ruby's of object oriented features, my ambition was to follow the principles of object oriented design as closely as possible, in particular the single responsibility principle and DRY, by extracting each functionality into its own method wherever possible.

## App functionality
* Add students to the directory
* Save added students to a chosen file
* Display all enrolled students
* Display students grouped by their cohort
* Load students from a file
* Delete students individually
* Delete an entire cohort
* Print the app source code to the console

## Technologies used
* Ruby
* Command Line
* CSV

## How to use

Clone this repository:
* git@github.com:AJ8GH/student-directory.git
* https://github.com/AJ8GH/student-directory.git

cd into main project directory:
`student-directory`

Launch the app by running the following command in terminal shell:
```shell
ruby directory.rb
```

Experiment with the features through the interactive_menu
* Add your own roster of students to the Academy
* Save them under a filename of your choice
* Load a file of students
* Delete students and cohorts
* Display the students and cohorts each time you manipulate the data and watch them change!

## Get in touch

If you have any ideas on how the app could be improved, either functionally, or design-wise, I'd love to hear them!
